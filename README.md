# **[Your Game Name]**

## ðŸªµ **Overview**
**[Your Game Name]** is a resource-gathering simulation game built using Unity. Players manage villagers to gather wood, stone, and gold while protecting them from enemies and managing the growth of their settlement. This game is an evolving project with an aim to balance simplicity and engaging strategy mechanics.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**
### What I Want to Achieve:
- **Dynamic Villager AI**: Intelligent villagers that gather resources efficiently, prioritize tasks, and avoid threats.  
- **User-Customizable Tasks**: Players can assign priorities for villagers (e.g., 50% gather wood, 50% gather stone).  
- **Defensive Gameplay**: Introduce enemies that require guards to protect villagers while they work.  
- **Engaging Resource Management**: Create a dynamic system for resource storage and utilization that visually updates in the UI.  
- **Building Expansion**: Enable building upgrades or expansions to improve resource efficiency or capacity.

## ðŸ›  **Current Features**
Hereâ€™s what has been implemented so far:

### Villager AI
- **Gathering AI**: Villagers automatically move to nearby resources (wood, stone, or gold) and start collecting.  
- **Task Assignment**: Villagers can prioritize specific resources based on player preferences.  
- **Resource Dropping**: Villagers return to the town hall to deposit their inventory when full.  

### Resource Management
- **Dynamic Tracking**: Resource totals (wood, stone, gold) are tracked and displayed to the player.  
- **UI Updates**: Real-time updates to the user interface when resources are collected and stored.  

### Environment
- **Resource Nodes**: Static resources like trees and rocks for villagers to collect from.  
- **Home Base (Town Hall)**: A central hub for depositing and storing collected resources.

## ðŸš€ **Planned Features**
These are the features I plan to add next:

1. **Defensive Systems**:
   - Add enemies that can harm villagers.  
   - Introduce a guard unit or turret to protect the settlement.  

2. **Building Upgrades**:
   - Allow players to expand their town hall or add new structures for increased capacity and efficiency.  

3. **Villager Behavior Enhancements**:
   - Add idle states and animations for villagers when unassigned tasks.  
   - Smarter pathfinding to avoid blocked routes or overlapping villagers.  

4. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Particles or effects when resources are collected or deposited.  
   - Town hall upgrade visuals to reflect player progression.  

5. **Player Customization**:
   - Implement a UI for dynamically assigning villager tasks.  
   - Enable the player to set specific villager priorities dynamically during gameplay.

## ðŸ“‹ **Progress**
### Features Completed:
- Villagers move to and gather from specific resource nodes.
- Villagers dynamically return resources to the town hall.
- Resources (wood, stone, gold) are tracked and updated in the UI.
- Simple animations: Running and chopping based on state.

### In Progress:
